# Interactive Sales Dashboard for The Bike Haven

#### Project Overview

###### Project Title: Interactive Sales Dashboard for The Bike Haven

###### Objective: Create an informative and visually interactive Tableau dashboard for analyzing sales data of a bike shop called "The Bike Haven" to help track sales performance, identify key trends, and assist in decision-making.

#### Problem Statement

The Bike Haven, a small bike shop in San Francisco, sells a variety of products including bikes, clothing, accessories, and components. The sales manager, Chris, aims to enhance the company's sales reporting by transitioning from static reports to interactive dashboards that allow for better data insights.

As a Business analyst, your task is to design a Tableau dashboard using SQL queries to merge and preprocess the necessary data and create visualizations that help understand sales trends and performance.

#### Project Requirements

Functionalities and Key Metrics:

Top 10 Products by Sales Amount: Identify the products that generate the most revenue.

Top 10 Customers: Highlight the most valuable customers.

Sales Figures vs. Budget: Compare actual sales performance to the budget for each month.

Sales Figures by Region/City: Display sales across different regions to identify geographic trends.

Product Categories vs. Sales Amount: Analyze product category performance to understand which ones drive the most revenue.

#### User Experience:

The dashboard must be visually appealing, interactive, and easy to navigate.

Filters must be implemented to allow sales representatives to view data specific to their customers or products.

The dashboard should be accessible on various devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

#### Data Sources:

Postgres SQL Database: The sales data was provided in a Postgres database with 7 tables: customer, sales, date, product, category, subcategory, and geography.

SQL was used to merge tables like product, category, subcategory, and customer with geography data.

Unnecessary columns were removed, and the clean data was exported to CSV files for loading into Tableau.

Budget Spreadsheet: A provided CSV file contains the budgeted sales figures for 2023, which is used to compare against actual sales figures.

#### Dataset:

The sales data spans over the last two years, and the budget comparison data pertains to the current year (2023).

#### Tools Used

Tableau Desktop: To build the interactive sales dashboard and visualizations.

Postgres SQL: For data extraction, merging, and preprocessing.

pgAdmin: For managing and querying the Postgres database.

Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets: For handling the budget data.

#### Dashboard Visualizations

The following are key visualizations included in the dashboard:

Top 10 Products by Sales: A bar chart ranking the top-selling products by revenue.

Top 10 Customers: A table or bar chart displaying the highest revenue-generating customers.

Sales vs. Budget: A line chart comparing actual sales against budgeted sales, broken down by month.

Sales by Region/City: A map visualization showing sales performance across various geographic regions.

Product Categories vs. Sales: A bar chart showing sales by product category, allowing quick insight into which categories are most profitable.

Additional visualizations may be included to highlight other trends or metrics, depending on the business requirements.

#### Deliverables

Final Files: Tableau Dashboard (.twbx): The final interactive Tableau dashboard that meets all requirements.

PDF of Dashboard: A high-resolution A4 portrait-sized PDF of the dashboard.


#### Load Data:

Open the .twbx Tableau workbook in Tableau Desktop.

If required, refresh the data connections with the provided CSV files.

Navigate the Dashboard:

Explore the visualizations to identify key sales insights.

Use the provided filters to narrow down data by region, product, or customer.

Review Comparisons:

View actual sales performance against budgeted figures to monitor goals and objectives.

Identify top-performing products and customers to make data-driven business decisions.
